`crabml` is a llama.cpp compatible (and equally fast!) AI inference engine written in ü¶Ä **Rust**, which runs everywhere with the help of üéÆ **WebGPU**.

## Project Goals

`crabml` is designed with the following objectives in mind:

- ü§ñ Focus solely on inference.
- üéÆ Runs on browsers, desktops, and servers everywhere with the help of **WebGPU**.
- ‚è© **SIMD**-accelerated inference on inexpensive hardware.
- üíº `mmap()` from day one, minimized memory requirement with various quantization support.
- üëæ Hackable & embeddable.

## Supported Models

`crabml` supports the following models in GGUF format:

- ü¶ô Llama
- ü¶ô Gemma
- üöÑ On the way: Mistral MoE, QWen, StarCoder, Llava, and more! 

For more information, you can visit [How to Get GGUF Models](https://github.com/crabml/crabml/blob/main/docs/how-to-get-gguf-models.md) to learn how to download the GGUF files you need.

## Supported Quantization Methods

`crabml` supports the following quantization methods on the CPU:

- 8 bits: Q8_0, Q8_1
- 6 bits: Q6_K
- 5 bits: Q5_0, Q5_1, Q5_k
- 4 bits: Q4_0, Q4_1, Q4_k
- 3 bits: Q3_k
- 2 bits: Q2_k

The GPU quantization support is on the way!

## Usage

### Building the Project

To build `crabml`, set the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to enable specific target features. For example, to enable NEON on ARM architectures, use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+neon"`. Then build the project with the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command compiles the project in release mode, which optimizes the binary for performance.

### Running an Example

After building the project, you can run an example inference by executing the `crabml-cli` binary with appropriate arguments. For instance, to use the `tinyllamas-stories-15m-f32.gguf` model to generate text based on the prompt "captain america", execute the command below:

```bash
./target/release/crabml-cli \
  -m ./testdata/tinyllamas-stories-15m-f32.gguf \
  "captain america" --steps 100 \
  -t 0.8 -p 1.0
```

In this command:

- `-m` specifies the checkpoint file.
- `--steps` defines the number of tokens to generate.
- `-t` sets the temperature, which controls the randomness of the output.
- `-p` sets the probability of sampling from the top-p.
