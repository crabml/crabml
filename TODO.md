- [x] add basic WGPU tensor support
  - referenced: https://github.com/0hq/WebGPT/blob/main/condensed/condensed.js
  - referenced: https://github.com/burn-rs/burn/blob/main/burn-wgpu/src/template/matmul/naive.wgsl
  - referenced: https://github.com/huggingface/candle/blob/main/candle-core/src/cpu_backend.rs
- [x] factor out TensorArithmetic
- [x] revise the dot product attention primitive
  - reference mlx: https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx-llama/blob/main/llm_mlx_llama.py#L81
  - learn the kv cache layout
- [x] use uniform to store the meta buffers
- [x] a better gemv
- [x] refactor the buf code
- [x] q8_0 dot product
- [x] compare the matmul q8_0 FLOPS between ggml and crabml
  - [x] aligh the performance on dot prod: try using manual neon instructions
- [x] find the performance difference between ggml
  - [x] add performance metrics on every token
  - [x] add b_offset to dot product
- [ ] ggml matmul: ~65ms per token, crabml: ~75ms per token, about 10ms slower
  - [x] add GEMV benchmark on 3200 x 8640, then 8640 x 3200
  - [ ] tile seems no effect at all, maybe the performance gap is due to the memory reuse?
- [ ] q8 quantization on webgpu
  - [ ] add dequantize in CpuTensor
